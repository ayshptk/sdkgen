# sdkgen

this is a (WIP) experiment to generate JS (probably other languages in the future) SDK wrappers built on top of your smart contract using nothing other than your smart contract address. 


it currently only supports mainnet verified contracts. but I'll add support for other networks (and local contracts) in the near future. feel free to send me a dm [@ayshptk](https://twitter.com/ayshptk) / shoot me an email at [hey@ayush.sh](mailto:hey@ayush.sh) to request API keys (free). 


## installation
```
npm install @ayshptk/sdkgen -g
```

## usage
simply call the `sdkgen` command and follow the instructions. you might need to enter your etherscan API key and sdkgen api key when you try it for the first time.

```
$ sdkgen
```
